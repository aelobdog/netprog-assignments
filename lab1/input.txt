First, a new project: visurf. 
I announced this a few days ago,
but the short of it is that I am 
building a minimal Wayland-only 
frontend for the NetSurf web 
browser which uses vi-inspired 
keybindings. Since the announcement
there has been some good progress:
touch support, nsvirc, tabs, key 
repeat, and so on. Some notable
medium-to-large efforts ahead of 
us include a context menu on right 
click, command completion and 
history, kinetic scrolling via 
touch, pinch-to-zoom, clipboard 
support, and a readability mode. 
Please help! Itâ€™s pretty easy to 
get involved: join the IRC channel 
at #netsurf on libera.chat and ask
for something to do.
