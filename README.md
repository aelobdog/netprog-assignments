The repository contains the following:
- Lab 1

- Assignment One

  (To find out more, refer to the pdf in the associated directory)

  - P1

    Task : To create a Bash-like shell with support for double and triple pipes. 

  - P2

    Task : To imlement a custom filesystem that allows big files (>= 1Mb) to be split into chunks and stored on separate "machines". The implementation is not fully complete but it was a great learning opportunity.

  - P3

    Task : To implement a cluster shell. The cluster shell runs a server and lets multiple clients run commands on each other and stitches all the outputs together correctly to return the required output to the process/client that ran the command.

- Assingment Two

  (To find out more, refer to the pdf in the associated directory)

  - P1

    Task : To create a chat server and client system that allows users to JOIN, CHAT and LEAVE the session. The program was implemented on one system and all clients are assumed to be running on the same device.

  - P2

    Task : To create an event driven web server that can display the contents of the file provided in the webpage input box. If the file has a .cgi extension, the browser recieves the output of the file post execution instead.

  - P3

    Task : To implement a port and IP address scanner (on the subnet determined using the user input [in the form of a network mask])
